- the eight commands
- other characters ignored (= comments)
- ip incremented after each command, except cases of [, ]
- ip, dp
- 30k linear data space (most common, alt. unlimited)
- data initialized to zero, dp at 0(left)
- dp below 0: ignore and undefined behaviour (most common), error and halt, extend dynamically, wrap around
- ip starts at 1st command
- program ends if ip points after last command
- ASCII input stream
- ASCII output stream
- every [ and ] match each other? syntax error if not (interpreter warning)
- EOL / Newline: only 10 ("\n", Unix/MacOS/Amiga, Standard), alt. 13+10 (Windows)
- EOF at input: no change at dp (original U.M.) / 0 at dp / const EOF at dp (= -1)
- cell size 8 bit (most common, alt. 16, 32, 64 bit)
- . and , read / write data in bytes
- data cell wraparound yes (most common)
- data type unsigned char (byte)
- source code is single file of ASCII text, filename ends with ".b"
- input and output interspersed together in chronological order
- input bytes will be held until they are requested by the program; bytes from the keyboard may also be line-buffered, i.e. they may not be available to the program until a newline has been typed
-  if a program requests input from the keyboard and there is none available, the program will be paused until more input becomes available
- output should be in a monospaced font
-  i/o should be done during execution, so interactive programs work



###  notes  ###
To display the ASCII character "7" we must add 48 to the value 7.
We use a loop to compute 48 = 6 * 8.
[This is an initial comment loop. Its content is never executed because
the cell at dp is zero at the beginning.]
The easy way to match brackets is to use a stack: when a '[' is encountered, push its location on the stack; when a ']' is encountered, pop the location of the matching '[' off the stack. SP must not become negative.
